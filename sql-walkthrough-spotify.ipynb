Similarly, the tracks file has an artists column that includes lists. Relational databases don't work well with lists, instead these should be expanded out to form their own many-to-many relationship tables. \n",

    "It should also be noted that to help reduce size for ease of loading into the Postgres database, I deleted any artist with less than 5000 followers from the artists file. Additionally, I deleted any track from before 2011 as well as any track with a popularity less than 50 from the tracks file. "
